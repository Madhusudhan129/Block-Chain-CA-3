# Audit Report: CryptoRoulette Smart Contract

## 1. Contract Overview
The CryptoRoulette contract allows users to guess a secret number stored on-chain for a chance to win the contract's balance. It includes functionality for playing the game, managing funds, and self-destruction. The audit identified multiple vulnerabilities, including reentrancy risks, reliance on outdated and insecure Solidity features, and poor randomness generation.

## 2. Vulnerability: Dangerous External Calls (Reentrancy Risk)
- **Location**: `CryptoRoulette.play(uint256)` and `CryptoRoulette.disableContract()`
- **Severity**: High
- **Description**:
  - Both the `play()` function and the `disableContract()` function make external calls to send Ether to the user (`msg.sender` in `play()` and `owner` in `disableContract()`).
  - These external calls are followed by state updates and event emissions, which can expose the contract to reentrancy attacks. In such attacks, the external address (e.g., the player or owner) can re-enter the contract before the state changes are finalized, potentially allowing malicious actors to drain funds.
- **Exploitation**:
  - An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by re-entering the contract during the transfer of funds, enabling them to withdraw more funds than intended, potentially draining the contract balance.
- **Fix**:
  - Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. First, update the contract state (such as updating balances or changing the paused flag) before making any external calls.
  - Additionally, using a `ReentrancyGuard` can help prevent reentrancy attacks by blocking re-entry during a function execution.
```solidity
uint256 contractBalance = address(this).balance;
lastPlayed = block.timestamp;  // Update state before transferring funds
shuffle();
emit FundsTransferred(msg.sender, contractBalance);  // Emit event before external call
(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: contractBalance}("");  // External call
require(success, "Transfer failed");
